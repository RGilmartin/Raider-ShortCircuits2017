## Raiders Short-Circuits

This repo contains the code for the 2017 relic recovery game by team 10975. 

Our code is for the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC). FIRST is a non-profit organization that promotes the ideas of STEM and Gracious Professionalism- robotics competitions are a medium to carry forth these ideas.

We are working hard to add not only code for our own robot, but add a core that can be used by all teams, new and old, to get a head start on their programming.
